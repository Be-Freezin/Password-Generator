# Password-Generator
 A tool to generate a random password

 What was originally a fairly easy Password generator app, only generating characters from all three types of characters(Letters, symbols, and numbers) I wanted to challenge myself and give the user and option to choose from. 
 
 We did some mighty fine googling to figure out how to make toggle switches in CSS (I haven't explored how to do this fully, and figured now is a good time to get some practice and knowledge of it). I wanted to make this Password generator different then others i've seen and add these toggle features.(im sure there are plenty like this out there, but thats besides the point)

 This was definitely a really fun challenge and a few aspects took my head for a spin, specifically really dialing in the order of if,else if statements. I realized that having the most specific statements on top of the if loop is crucial, and cascading down to the most general conditions.

 I could spend a lot more time and really dial in the code and make it cleaner, i feel like i have a bit to much repeating code and that could get fixed. Right now, i am happy with it and wanna push forward into the next project and keep learning and bettering my skills.
